# Final-Year-Research-Project
Worked on the final year research project which was detecting approaching vehicles towards users using Audio  Signal processing. Here in this project we have collected various audio samples of vehicles including engine sounds,  Horn sounds and then analysed the data samples in search of identifying different audio features which can be used  in classifying the audio signals. We have extracted different audio features from the audio samples including  amplitude envelope, spectrograms, MFCC, etc and proceeded with spectrograms in classifying the audio signals  using machine learning models.
