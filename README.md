# Final-Year-Research-Project
Worked on the final year research project which was detecting approaching vehicles towards users using Audio  Signal processing. Here in this project we have collected various audio samples of vehicles including engine sounds,  Horn sounds and then analysed the data samples in search of identifying different audio features which can be used  in classifying the audio signals. We have extracted different audio features from the audio samples including  amplitude envelope, spectrograms, MFCC, etc and proceeded with spectrograms in classifying the audio signals  using machine learning models.

ABSTRACT

Here in this project, we have designed a system which is basically capable of detecting approaching 
vehicles towards the users and with such information available, the information could be used in 
alerting the distracted users about approaching vehicles when they are about to enter an intersection 
or wander into roads. The main objective of this project is to detect the presence of a vehicle and 
identifying whether a vehicle is approaching the user or leaving the user. In this study we have 
taken the approach with audio signal processing. We have analysed the sounds of the vehicles 
which were both collected and already existing data samples and obtained the results using 
Machine learning techniques. Processing of the audio signals was done in three steps, identifying 
audio features, extracting the audio features and detecting the presence of a vehicle and identifying 
whether the vehicles are approaching users or leaving. We have identified different audio features
and out of them we have proceeded with the spectrograms of the audio signals since those 
spectrograms can be used in classifying the audio signals. Classification of the audio signals was 
done using Python and the results were obtained successfully.
